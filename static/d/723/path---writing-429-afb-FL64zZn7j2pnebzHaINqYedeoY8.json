It's a powerful tool for designing both web and mobile applications and I wanted to use it for this project. I opted for a flat design incorporating tiles, reminiscent of album artwork. Having been a musician for most of my life &#x26; worked in the music industry, I have always loved the visual aesthetic of album covers. They each tell a unique story in while collectively representing the tastes of the owner.</p>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/b08f0ed2464c6c23ba62105a1c1eb2da/abb02/Volta_Rounded-1491871528864.png\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block;  max-width: 650px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 65.94926979246733%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABQAAAANCAYAAACpUE5eAAAACXBIWXMAAAsSAAALEgHS3X78AAAB2klEQVQ4y2VT16pCQQz02+y9Y6/YO4rYxd4bqI/igz86lwmsqPchbE5OMjuTZDVWqxW/ZrFY4HA44PP54Ha74fV65dvlcsHj8UiMOZ/5ytf8Bm02G0wmE4rFIs7nM+bzOZbLJWazGUajkcSGwyHMZrPk0v4BqoDBYIDRaIROp4NerxefBfQJQONlNOYwn6YwaBoFxqJCoYBsNotut4tGo4Fms4lYLCZnvV5HLpeTk3mM5fN5tFotufiLIVlotVpst1ssFgs8Hg+RttlskE6n5Vyv1yJ1v98LaLlcRq/XkxrF8l8PySaZTCIUCr0HQD+VSokFAgEZCJllMhlhSuDPtr0BSZssjscjqtUqwuGwFFQqFaxWK0yn07fs2+0mKpj7er1kA9hfAVTIbHQ0GkUkEhFWZEcm/Pb7/XIB/VKphGAwKGqUgs9Jaz4nxP5wRe73Ow6Hg/RnPB6Lz57WajWcTicZWL/fFyW73e5d/yWZlHk7Zcbjcdjt9nchB6N6S1Ay5tKzrxzMvykryZTYbreFJYE6nY4sOFeJbBKJBCaTiUyVjFjDdfvaw8+1GQwGMpjn84nr9SpyGFP7RgWXy0WWmjWq9uulfOrnjZROCcrnPxVjG5xO5xfA71v+A1VpHO7i346YAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Volte Rounded\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/b08f0ed2464c6c23ba62105a1c1eb2da/10273/Volta_Rounded-1491871528864.png\"\n        srcset=\"/static/b08f0ed2464c6c23ba62105a1c1eb2da/9b14a/Volta_Rounded-1491871528864.png 163w,\n/static/b08f0ed2464c6c23ba62105a1c1eb2da/94962/Volta_Rounded-1491871528864.png 325w,\n/static/b08f0ed2464c6c23ba62105a1c1eb2da/10273/Volta_Rounded-1491871528864.png 650w,\n/static/b08f0ed2464c6c23ba62105a1c1eb2da/2fc6f/Volta_Rounded-1491871528864.png 975w,\n/static/b08f0ed2464c6c23ba62105a1c1eb2da/a8a2c/Volta_Rounded-1491871528864.png 1300w,\n/static/b08f0ed2464c6c23ba62105a1c1eb2da/abb02/Volta_Rounded-1491871528864.png 1301w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>The new design is built to translate from a website, to videos &#x26; motion graphics and social media.

I must say I was uncomfortable when I first started learning React because it seemed to violate everything I had learned since the days of table based layouts and before CSS, that is the separation of concerns:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>HTML for content</li>\n<li>CSS for styling</li>\n<li>JavaScript for behavior</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Over the years, the lines of demarcation between one language and another have been blurring ever so slowly with inline style tags in html, CSS animations for animation, etc. With the advent of React (and other JS frameworks/libraries) there seems to be more weight behind having more performant front-ends rather than one focused on pure markup correctness &#x26; separation of concerns. It's a complete 180 degree shift that is fascinating to me. With that being said, it was a bit strange for me to be writing HTML inside of JavaScript files but it didn't take long for me to see the benefits. It was very apparent that having behavior &#x26; display code of a component in one location (rather than separate in many other files) made the re-use, predictability &#x26; maintainability much simpler.</p>\n<h3>Redux</h3>\n<p>This site not a complicated in regards to state so Redux seemed a bit of overkill. The front-end makes AJAX calls to the API for each page. Each page is stored in it's own object in the Redux store. If the page has already been navigated to, rather that making an additional API call, the page data is loaded from Redux. One day I may refactor the AJAX calls to see how making a single API call to load the entire site data load would effect the performance. My guess is that it would probably be an improvement.</p>\n<h3>React Styled-Components</h3>\n<p>Taking this re-usable component idea further, I wondered if it was possible to bring CSS into a component rather than having all CSS styles located in one monolithic stylesheet. <a href=\"https://styled-components.com/\">Styled-Components</a> to the rescue! Styled-Components allowed my to extract the CSS for each component out of the main stylesheet and into the component itself. Styled-Components also allows for logic in CSS styles based on React props. I did find it a bit difficult to test as it adds an additional layer of abstraction to your components. Getting Jest &#x26; Enzyme to render a component correctly was a bit of a challenge and in some cases a bit hacky. It's early on and I expect Style-Components to get better and these issues ironed out. It's extremely powerful and it will be interesting to see how it progresses.</p>\n<h3>SVG's Hooray!</h3>\n<p>All image assets are SVG's (with the exception of the 'About' banner) and are stored on a static assets server (<a href=\"http://static.veryaustin.com\">http://static.veryaustin.com</a>). I could have used Webpack to package up all of the image assets in the deployed app, but I wanted to see how performant React was when loading image assets from external locations. The 'Tools And Technology' tile logos are loaded SVG's loaded from the static assets server.

TravisCI pulls the master branch of veryaustin.com from <a href=\"http://github.com\">Github</a>, runs all the Jest testing suite and builds the front-end application for production. Once successful, the build is pushed to an Amazon S3 bucket which feeds an Amazon CloudFront CDN distribution to the various data centers around the world. It's a setup I'm pretty happy with so far.</p>\n<h1>Wrap-Up</h1>\n<p>To wrap things up, this has been a really great learning experience in a variety of areas. I've had many victories and have taken several dead end paths but nevertheless, it's part of the learning process. I set out to use as many of the latest front-end technologies I could and apply what I've been learning to build something beautiful and I'm pretty happy with how it turned out.</p>"}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Homebrew Cask","date":"April 5th, 2017","tags":["tools","tools-of-the-trade","automation","workflow","macos"],"slug":"/homebrew-cask"},"html":"<p>Join me as we look at Homebrew Cask, command line installation of desktop applications.

Additionally, you may not know that there has been a shift in the pixel density of those devices to ones with increasingly more pixels per square inch. If you are in the Apple hardware camp, they like to call these 'Retina' displays since, they have such high resolution screens that the eye cannot discern pixels at a normal operating distance.</p>\n<p>Traditionally screens have included about 72 pixels per square inch (ppi). Newer screens usually have a pixel density of around 300ppi. This is great for the end user because it allows the device to render the content with much more clarity. If we don't display an image with high enough resolution, it will show up as blurry. If we display an image with high resolution on a small screen, we make the site load slow and waste a lot of bandwidth.</p>\n<p>SVG's are composed of vectors and not pixels. A vector is a point in empty space with and x &#x26; y coordinate. If you connect them together you can create shapes. They are infinitely scalable.</p>\n<p>If a file needs a large variant from pixel to it's neighboring pixels, it won't benefit from being a vector. It would actually take up more space than a rasterized file.</p>\n<p>Rule of thumb: If are using a photograph, you should almost always use a rasterized image. If it's more graphical (logo), map, chart that doesn't need extreme amounts of color detail, an SVG is optimal</p>\n<p>If you have ever tried to enlarge a digital photograph, you have probably seen that they are composed tiny squares called pixels.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>SVG is actually an XML markup language.</p>\n<p>SVG Elements: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element</a>\nSVG Attributes: <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute\">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute</a></p>\n<p>SVGGO Optimizer: <a href=\"https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui\">https://github.com/svg/svgo-gui</a></p>\n<hr>\n<p>Modifying SVG with CSS\nYou must embed the svg into the HTML.

Source Maps are also provided for easy in browser debugging. Since image assets account for the majority bandwidth of most websites, image optimization is also baked in to reduce the size of PNG and JPG images.</p>\n<h3>Supported Languages:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Less</li>\n<li>Sass</li>\n<li>Stylus</li>\n<li>JavaScript</li>\n<li>CoffeeScript</li>\n<li>TypeScript</li>\n<li>Haml</li>\n<li>Jade</li>\n<li>Slim</li>\n<li>Markdown</li>\n<li>JSON</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"./images/CodeKit_Languages-1477531897939.png\" alt=\"CodeKit Launguages\"></p>"}}]}},"pageContext":{}}

I had been looking for a project to try it out and I found it very easy to wire up layouts and \"compose\" administration pages to provide a streamlined administration page that wouldn't be overwhelming for Nathan to use. As an added feature, I built in the ability for Nathan to include iTunes affiliate links so visitors could visit the iTunes store directly from his site and preview/buy the album.

This re-design was challenging in that while I did have some familiarity with the application, several years had past and several other developers had worked on it. Being an Ember application, it took some time to get the project running locally without having access to the backend services it was dependant on. When the application was initially developed, both the client and administration pages shared the same design aesthetic. The new client facing page required a different design so I had to take care to insure the client facing CSS styles were isolated from the administration page styles.

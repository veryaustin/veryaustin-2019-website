Stan Dudley is a piano technician & performer based in Des Moines, IA. After many years of providing piano services to the Des Moines area, Stan determined that he needed to market his services on the internet to compete with others in the field. Initially he was planning on using a 'Site Building' application provided free by his ISP but after consulting with him, we determined we could leverage current free resources to build a more current and marketable website. This site is runs on Bootstrap & CraftCMS, providing a modern design with customized admin specifically tailored to Stan for managing content.

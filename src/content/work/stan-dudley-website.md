Stan Dudley is a piano technician & performer based in Des Moines, IA. After many years of providing piano services to the Des Moines area, Stan determined that he needed to market his services on the internet to compete with others in the field. Initially he was planning on using a 'Site Building' application from the 90's, provided by his ISP. After consulting with him (and being a good steward of the web), we determined we could leverage current free resources to build a more current, marketable and effective website for his business. This site is runs on Bootstrap & CraftCMS, providing a modern design with a customized admin specifically tailored to Stan's needs.

Nathan Yarborough is a Grammy nominated recording engineer based in Nashville, TN. Nathan required a website to list his credits and allow visitors to contact him. Crediting has become more and more fractured over the past few years so he felt like he wanted an authoritative place to display his credits. This site built using CraftCMS. I had been looking for a project to try it out and I found it very easy to wire up layouts and "compose" administration pages to provide a streamlined administration page that wouldn't be overwhelming for Nathan to use. As an added feature, I built in the ability for Nathan to include iTunes affiliate links so visitors could visit the iTunes store directly from his site and preview/buy the album. The associated repo is a non-customized static HTML/SCSS version of the website.

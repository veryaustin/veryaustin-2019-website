Nathan Yarborough is a Grammy nominated recording engineer based in Nashville, TN. Nathan only had two requirements for his website: 1). List his credits & 2). Allow visitors to contact him. Crediting has become more and more fractured over the past few years so he felt like he wanted an authoritative place to display his credits. This site is built using CraftCMS and was the first site I used it for. I found it very easy to wire up layouts and "compose" administration pages, allowing me to provide a streamlined administration page that wouldn't be overwhelming for clients to use. As an added feature, I built in the ability for Nathan to include iTunes affiliate links so visitors can visit/purchase from the iTunes store directly from his site. The associated repo is a non-customized static HTML/SCSS version of the website.

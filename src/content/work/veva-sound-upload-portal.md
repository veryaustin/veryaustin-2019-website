Veva Sound is the world-wide leader in developing standardized methodologies for the collection, documentation and preservation of recorded music. As Director of I.T. & Web Services, I was responsible for the design, management & development of new web applications & services providing clients easy access to all of the business and technical metadata assocated with their assets. I was also responsible for building internal tooling & processes to ensure data accuracy & integrity during long term/archival storage. All projects are internal to Veva Sound.

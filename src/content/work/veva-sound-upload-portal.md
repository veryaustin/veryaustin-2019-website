The VeVa Sound Uploader application allows Veva Sound to receive large auto projects from their clients. I was initially involved in both it's project management and development. Recently, VeVa Sound underwent an entire re-branding which required their customer facing tools to be redesigned to match. This re-design was challenging in that while I did have some familiarity with the application, several years had past and several other developers had worked on it. Being an Ember application, it took some time to get the project running locally without having access to the back-end services it was dependant on. When the application was initially developed, both the client and administration pages shared the same design aesthetic. The new client facing page required a different design so I had to take care to insure the client facing CSS styles were isolated from the administration page styles. The repo for this project is the initial HTML/SCSS styles that were later integrated into the Ember application.

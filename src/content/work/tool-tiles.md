With the 2019 edition of this website, came a second iteration consecutive design containing tiles. It only felt right to finally build an NPM package of React Components to I can reuse in other projects. Having never published to the NPM registry, this also was an opportunity to put something out there for the community. Tool Tiles is built using React, Styled Components & Sass, it renders a wide range of tool icons & tiles as SVG's. This project includes Storybook to interact with all of the included components. Please read more about it's development in my post about the [2019 version](/writing/2019-veryaustin-website/) of this website.

Entering the second iteration of a tiled theme for my personal website, I built an NPM package of React Components to be re-used in other projects. Having never published to the NPM registry, this was an opportunity to put something out there for the community. Tool Tiles is built using React, Styled Components & Sass, it renders a wide range of tool icons & tiles as SVG's. This project includes Storybook to interact with all of the included components. Please read more about it's development in my post about the [2019 version](/writing/2019-veryaustin-website/) of this website.

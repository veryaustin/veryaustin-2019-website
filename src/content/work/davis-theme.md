Davis is a clean & simple theme for the Ghost CMS that closely mimics the layout & design of my website from 2017. Upon initially writing the HTML markup, I found the conversion of my static HTML pages into dynamic Handlebars templates to be a breeze. Ghost is an open source blogging platform powered by Node. I have followed this project since it was started on Kickstarter in 2013 as it was attempting to simplify the process of online publishing. Seeing initial demos of what could be built with a completely new development stack than what many of the other CMS systems were using (PHP) was really interesting to me. Getting Ghost up and running on my local machine was my first experience using Node.

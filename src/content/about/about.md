Iâ€™m Austin Lauritsen & I'm a software engineer. In 2014, I decided to venture out on my own, away from my project management & I.T. related career path and focus on on developing for the web in HTML, JavaScript, React & Node.

Coming from an upbringing where I was interested in music & computers, I would build websites cataloging & documenting my musical interests. I received a degree in Mass Communications (Production Technology/Audio Engineering) and spent the first part of my career transferring, documenting & archiving music recordings. In late 2009 my career path began to shift when my employer had a variety of technical challenges involving, I.T., networking and web services. My curiously, coupled with a desire to automate and improve the tools I used every day, I eventually took over responsibilities of I.T. & Web Services and worked with a team of developers to build the companies' first customer facing portal. Within a few weeks of starting work on the customer portal project, I knew I wanted to dig deeper and become of developer. I was hooked.

Outside of work, I play Jazz, Funk, and Blues music with [Adam Dalton & The B-Sides](http://adamdaltonmusic.com/adam-dalton-t) and enjoy traveling with my wife. You can read more about what I'm into by visiting my [Now](/now) page.
